## 🗺️ The 8-Step EDA Framework

## STEP 1: Get to Know Your Dataset

### 🔍 What to Examine:
- **Dataset dimensions** (rows × columns)
- **Column names and meanings**
- **Data types** (numerical, categorical, dates)
- **Memory usage**
- **Sample of actual data**

### 📝 Key Questions to Ask:
1. How big is my dataset?
2. What variables do I have?
3. What does each column represent?
4. Are the data types correct?
5. Do I have enough data for analysis?

### 🛠️ Code Approach:
```python
# Basic dataset info
print(f"Shape: {df.shape}")
print(df.info())
print(df.dtypes.value_counts())

# See actual data
print(df.head())
print(df.tail())

# Memory usage
print(f"Memory: {df.memory_usage(deep=True).sum() / 1024**2:.2f} MB")
```

### 🎯 For Your Podcast Data:
- **Check**: Are episode lengths stored as numbers?
- **Verify**: Do podcast names look consistent?
- **Confirm**: Is the target variable `Listening_Time_minutes` numerical?

---

## STEP 2: Missing Values Investigation

### 🔍 What to Examine:
- **Which columns have missing values?**
- **How much data is missing?** (counts and percentages)
- **Are there patterns** in missing data?
- **Is missing data random** or systematic?

### 📝 Key Questions to Ask:
1. Which features have the most missing values?
2. Are missing values concentrated in certain rows?
3. Could missing values be meaningful? (e.g., "no guest" = missing guest popularity)
4. Can I still use features with missing data?
5. What's the best strategy to handle each type of missing value?

### 🛠️ Code Approach:
```python
# Missing value analysis
missing_counts = df.isnull().sum()
missing_percent = (missing_counts / len(df)) * 100

# Create missing values summary
missing_df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Count': missing_counts,
    'Percentage': missing_percent
}).sort_values('Count', ascending=False)

# Visualize missing patterns
import missingno as msno
msno.matrix(df)  # Shows missing value patterns
msno.bar(df)     # Shows missing value counts
```

### 🎯 For Your Podcast Data:
From your earlier analysis, you have:
- **Episode_Length_minutes**: ~9.5% missing
- **Guest_Popularity_percentage**: ~20% missing

**Strategic Questions:**
- Why is guest popularity missing? (Solo episodes?)
- Are missing episode lengths random or systematic?
- Should missing guest popularity become a "Has_Guest" feature?

---

## STEP 3: Target Variable Deep Dive

### 🔍 What to Examine:
- **Distribution shape** (normal, skewed, bimodal?)
- **Central tendency** (mean, median, mode)
- **Spread** (standard deviation, range, IQR)
- **Outliers** (extreme values that might be errors)
- **Unusual patterns** (gaps, clusters, unexpected values)

### 📝 Key Questions to Ask:
1. What's the typical listening time?
2. Is the distribution normal or skewed?
3. Are there outliers? (Very long/short listening times)
4. Do I need to transform the target variable?
5. Are there any impossible values? (Negative time, longer than episode?)

### 🛠️ Code Approach:
```python
# Descriptive statistics
target = df['Listening_Time_minutes']
print(target.describe())

# Distribution shape
print(f"Skewness: {target.skew():.2f}")
print(f"Kurtosis: {target.kurtosis():.2f}")

# Outlier detection (IQR method)
Q1 = target.quantile(0.25)
Q3 = target.quantile(0.75)
IQR = Q3 - Q1
outliers = target[(target < Q1 - 1.5*IQR) | (target > Q3 + 1.5*IQR)]
print(f"Outliers: {len(outliers)} ({len(outliers)/len(target)*100:.1f}%)")

# Visualizations
plt.hist(target, bins=50)  # Distribution
plt.boxplot(target)        # Outliers
```

### 🎯 For Your Podcast Data:
**Key Insights to Look For:**
- **Typical listening time**: What's normal for your podcasts?
- **Completion patterns**: Do people listen to full episodes?
- **Outliers**: Are there 8-hour listening times? (Possible errors)
- **Business logic**: Can listening time exceed episode length?

---

## STEP 4: Numerical Features Analysis

### 🔍 What to Examine:
- **Distribution of each numerical variable**
- **Correlation with target variable**
- **Relationships between numerical features**
- **Scale differences** (some features 0-1, others 0-100)
- **Outliers in each feature**

### 📝 Key Questions to Ask:
1. Which numerical features are most correlated with my target?
2. Are any features on very different scales?
3. Do I have features that are essentially the same? (multicollinearity)
4. Are there obvious data entry errors?
5. Should any features be transformed? (log, square root)

### 🛠️ Code Approach:
```python
# Get numerical columns
numerical_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns

# Descriptive statistics
print(df[numerical_cols].describe())

# Correlation with target
correlations = df[numerical_cols].corr()['Listening_Time_minutes'].sort_values(ascending=False)
print(correlations)

# Visualize distributions
for col in numerical_cols:
    plt.figure()
    plt.hist(df[col], bins=30)
    plt.title(f'Distribution of {col}')
    plt.show()
```

### 🎯 For Your Podcast Data:
**Expected Numerical Features:**
- `Episode_Length_minutes`: Should be positive, reasonable range (5-180 mins?)
- `Host_Popularity_percentage`: Should be 0-100
- `Guest_Popularity_percentage`: Should be 0-100 or missing
- `Number_of_Ads`: Should be non-negative integer

**Key Relationships to Explore:**
- Episode length vs listening time
- Host popularity vs listening time
- Number of ads vs listening time

---

## STEP 5: Categorical Features Analysis

### 🔍 What to Examine:
- **Unique values in each categorical column**
- **Frequency distribution** of categories
- **Relationship between categories and target**
- **High-cardinality features** (many unique values)
- **Inconsistent naming** (typos, case differences)

### 📝 Key Questions to Ask:
1. How many unique categories does each feature have?
2. Are categories balanced or is there strong dominance?
3. Which categories are associated with higher/lower target values?
4. Are there data quality issues? (typos, inconsistent naming)
5. Should high-cardinality features be grouped or encoded differently?

### 🛠️ Code Approach:
```python
# Get categorical columns
categorical_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns

# Analyze each categorical feature
for col in categorical_cols:
    print(f"\n--- {col} ---")
    print(f"Unique values: {df[col].nunique()}")
    print("Value counts:")
    print(df[col].value_counts().head())
    
    # Relationship with target
    if 'Listening_Time_minutes' in df.columns:
        avg_by_category = df.groupby(col)['Listening_Time_minutes'].mean().sort_values(ascending=False)
        print("Average listening time by category:")
        print(avg_by_category.head())
```

### 🎯 For Your Podcast Data:
**Expected Categorical Features:**
- `Podcast_Name`: 48 unique values (high cardinality!)
- `Genre`: 10 unique values (manageable)
- `Publication_Day`: 7 values (weekdays)
- `Publication_Time`: 4 values (time periods)
- `Episode_Sentiment`: 3 values (Negative, Neutral, Positive)

**Key Questions:**
- Which genres have highest listening times?
- Do people listen more on weekends?
- Is morning vs evening publication important?
- Are positive sentiment episodes listened to more?

---

## STEP 6: Relationships and Patterns

### 🔍 What to Examine:
- **Correlation matrix** for numerical features
- **Categorical vs numerical** relationships
- **Interaction effects** between features
- **Multicollinearity** issues
- **Feature redundancy**

### 📝 Key Questions to Ask:
1. Which features are strongly correlated with each other?
2. Do categorical features create different patterns in numerical features?
3. Are there interaction effects? (e.g., genre + day combinations)
4. Do I have redundant features that measure the same thing?
5. What are the strongest predictors of my target variable?

### 🛠️ Code Approach:
```python
# Correlation matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
correlation_matrix = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm', center=0)

# Categorical vs numerical relationships
for cat_col in categorical_cols:
    plt.figure()
    df.boxplot(column='Listening_Time_minutes', by=cat_col)
    plt.title(f'Listening Time by {cat_col}')

# Find highly correlated pairs
high_corr_pairs = []
for i in range(len(correlation_matrix.columns)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(correlation_matrix.columns)):
        corr = correlation_matrix.iloc[i, j]
        if abs(corr) > 0.8:
            high_corr_pairs.append((correlation_matrix.columns[i], 
                                  correlation_matrix.columns[j], corr))
```

### 🎯 For Your Podcast Data:
**Key Relationships to Explore:**
- Host popularity vs guest popularity
- Episode length vs listening time (should be strong!)
- Genre vs listening patterns
- Day/time vs listening behavior
- Sentiment vs engagement

---

## STEP 7: Outlier Detection and Data Quality

### 🔍 What to Examine:
- **Statistical outliers** using IQR or Z-score methods
- **Business logic violations** (impossible values)
- **Data entry errors** (typos, wrong formats)
- **Consistency issues** across related features

### 📝 Key Questions to Ask:
1. Are outliers real or data entry errors?
2. Do outliers represent interesting edge cases?
3. Should outliers be removed, capped, or transformed?
4. Are there impossible combinations of values?
5. Is my data internally consistent?

### 🛠️ Code Approach:
```python
# Statistical outlier detection
def detect_outliers_iqr(df, column):
    Q1 = df[column].quantile(0.25)
    Q3 = df[column].quantile(0.75)
    IQR = Q3 - Q1
    lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
    upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
    return df[(df[column] < lower_bound) | (df[column] > upper_bound)]

# Business logic checks
# Example: Listening time shouldn't exceed episode length
invalid_listening = df[df['Listening_Time_minutes'] > df['Episode_Length_minutes']]
print(f"Invalid listening times: {len(invalid_listening)}")

# Consistency checks
# Example: Episodes with guests should have guest popularity > 0
guest_inconsistency = df[(df['Guest_Popularity_percentage'] == 0) & 
                        (df['Episode_Title'].str.contains('guest', case=False))]
```

### 🎯 For Your Podcast Data:
**Specific Checks to Perform:**
- **Listening time vs episode length**: Can't listen longer than episode duration
- **Popularity percentages**: Should be 0-100 range
- **Episode numbers**: Should be sequential/reasonable
- **Ad counts**: Negative ads don't make sense
- **Missing patterns**: Are they logical?
